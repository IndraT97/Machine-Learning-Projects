# Main Purpose  


# Descriptive and Inferential Statistics Content Overview

## Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics deals with the main features of an existing dataset without making inferences or predictions about a larger population.

- **Population vs Sample**
  - **Population**: Complete set of observations we want to make predictions about.
  - **Sample**: A subset of the population.

- **Parameters vs Statistics**
  - A **parameter** is a characteristic of a population, while a **statistic** is a characteristic of a sample.
  - The goal of statistical inference is to use the sample to make inferences about population parameters.

- **Sampling Criteria (Random Sampling)**
  - Sample Size
  - Randomness
  - Representativeness

## Types of Data
- **Categorical / Qualitative Data**
  - Nominal
  - Ordinal
- **Numerical / Quantitative Data**
  - Discrete Data
  - Continuous Data

## Measure of Central Tendency
- **Mean**: Prone to outliers.
- **Median**: First sort the data.
- **Mode**
- **Trimmed Mean**: Remove a certain percentage of the smallest and largest values, then take the mean of the remaining values.
- **Weighted Mean**: (Sum of the product of each value and weight) / (Sum of weights)

## Measure of Dispersion (Spread in Data)
- **Range**: Largest value – smallest value.
- **Variance**: Average of squared differences between each data point and the mean.
- **Standard Deviation (SD)**: Why we can’t compare variability using SD—different units of measure and squaring.
- **Coefficient of Variation**: (SD / Mean) * 100%

## Types of Plots
- **Categorical vs Categorical Data**: Contingency Table / CrossTab
- **Categorical vs Numerical**: Bar Chart
- **Numerical vs Numerical**: Scatter Plot

## Probability Distribution
- **Random Variable**: A set of possible values from a random experiment.
- **Probability Distribution**: Probability distribution of discrete random variables is called **Probability Mass Function (PMF)**, and for continuous random variables, it is called **Probability Density Function (PDF)**.

### Normal Distribution (Gaussian Distribution)
- **Standard Normal Variate**: Mean = 0, SD = 1
- **Empirical Rule**: 68-95-99.7 Rule

## Confidence Interval
- A **confidence interval (CI)** is a range around a point estimate (such as a sample mean), indicating the uncertainty around the estimate.
- CI = Point Estimate ± Margin of Error

## Hypothesis Testing
- **Null Hypothesis**: No change or effect.
- **Alternate Hypothesis**: Some change or effect.
- Two approaches: **Rejection Region** and **P-Value Approach**.

## T-Test
- **One-sample T-Test**: Compares the sample mean to a known population mean.
- **Two-sample T-Test**: Compares the means of two populations.
- **Paired T-Test**: Compares means from related groups, such as before and after measurements.

## Chi-Square Test
- **Goodness-of-Fit Test**: Determines if the observed distribution fits a theoretical distribution.
- **Test for Independence**: Tests if two categorical variables are independent.

## ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)
- **One-Way ANOVA**: Compares the means of three or more independent groups.
- **Two-Way ANOVA**: Compares the effects of two factors on a dependent variable.

## P-Value Strength
- **p < 0.01**: Strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
- **0.01 ≤ p < 0.05**: Moderate evidence against the null hypothesis.
- **0.05 ≤ p < 0.1**: Weak evidence.
- **p ≥ 0.1**: No evidence against the null hypothesis.
